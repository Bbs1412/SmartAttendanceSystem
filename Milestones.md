This file highlights the milestones achieved in the project. The milestones are listed in the order they were achieved.

## Milestones


1. **First Version:**
    - Developed a basic face recognition system as the foundation of the project.
    - Focused extensively on the backend, optimizing Python code for core functionality.
    - The UI was minimal and primarily designed to accept user input.
    - Wanted to move away from relying on OpenCV windows and terminal outputs as the primary interface.
    - Introduced a simple web interface to improve usability and provide a more intuitive user experience.


2. **Second Version:**
    - This iteration focused entirely on upgrading the website UI.
    - Completely redesigned the interface, transforming it from a minimal input form into a fully interactive experience.
    - Introduced numerous new features to enhance functionality.
    - Implemented Light and Dark mode for better accessibility.
    - Added animations and improved transitions for a smoother, more polished user experience.
    - Planning to work on backend code optimization and improving the face recognition system in the next version.


3. **Third Version:**
    - Enhanced the backend code to improve performance and optimize face recognition.
    - Improved coding practices and documentation.
    - Implemented `DEBUG` variable for debug-logging.
    - Many other minor changes and project finalization.
